# Machine_learning_al_on_cars_dataset
Predicting a brand of a car using attributes like Miles/Gallon, Cylinders, cubic Inches, Horsepower, weight (in lbs), time to reach 60 miles, and year of release     
Perform different data mining operations, and ML algorithm and find suitable algorithm for the predicting Machine Learning Algorithm.  
ML Algorithms to be used for this categorical data are - 
	Decision Tree Algorithm,
	K-Means Algorithm,
	K-Nearest-Neighbours.
